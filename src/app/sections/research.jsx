                Research on developing embeddings for Indian Languages such as Tamil by analysing spectrograms. Further, the study 
                focuses on a computational model that builds towards developing a toolkit for user acceptance of language technologies.

                Conducted research on Self-Supervised Learning and pseudo-labeling using YOLOv5. This involved pre-training YOLOv5 and 
                YOLOv3 backbones to generate pseudo labels for multiple objects within an image.

                <li>
                Worked on mitigating Out-of-Distribution (OOD) errors in object detection during inference time and implemented a 
                method to transfer backbone weights from YOLOv5 to Ultralytics YOLOv5 following custom pre-training.
